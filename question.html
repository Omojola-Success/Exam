    <p>CSS can be used to add beauty to the html. HTML is just like the skeleton while CSS is the flesh. CSS is used to style 
        and layout web pages - for example, to make change to the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into 
        multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. Without CSS, websites would look very boring.

        Lastly, it's easy for users to learn and update, which makes global changes to style simple and quick.

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Host domain</h1>
    <p>An host domain service sells domains and registers them to an owner in exchange for a yearly subscription fee. A domain host, 
         such as example.com, is an internet service that handles your domain name by which visitors can use to find one. A domain
         is set up like this; www.YOURWEBSITENAME.com. The usual domain names are .com, .net, .org, .edu, .edu. By buying a domain 
         from a domain host, you gain ownership of that domain for as long as you pay the yearly fee. DNS records are used by domain 
         hosts to connect your domain name to email, websites, and other web services. To mention a few, popular domain hosts include
         GoDaddy, enom, DreamHost, and 1&1 IONOS. Hosting services work by maintaining stable and secure storage spaces. While domain host
         provide more than just simple data storage, it's a core part of their functionality. Hosts store data on hardware which 
         allows for easy maintenance and access by online users.
